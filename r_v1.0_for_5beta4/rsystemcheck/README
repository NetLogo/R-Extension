This is a NetLogo Extension to check the requirements for the R-Extension.
Copy the whole folder (rystemcheck) to the NetLogo extensions folder. Then
open the Systemcheck.nlogo file in NetLogo.


When to use it is described in the documentation of the R-Extension, section Troubleshooting.

For building the extension (jar) from source, use the Ant-file "build.xml". 

The home of the Extension is "http://netlogo-r-ext.berlios.de". 
Please post bug reports there.
